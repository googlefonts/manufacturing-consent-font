    Ah, <em>Manufacturing Consent</em>—the font that doesn’t just scream “serious journalism,” it calmly editorializes
    it in
    144-point Fraktur while subtly nudging your worldview. A glorious typographic wolf in Pulitzer-winning sheep’s
    clothing, this typeface borrows its gravitas from the New York Times masthead and then cheekily slaps a Noam Chomsky
    title on it, because irony is the last frontier of design. Perfect for your zine, blog, or rogue press release about
    how pigeons are government surveillance drones.

<p>Forked from the esteemed “Chomsky” font, <em>Manufacturing Consent</em> is for those who want their typography to
    look like it
    went to an Ivy League school but dropped out to start a podcast. Whether you're toppling empires or just mocking
    brunch culture, this free and open-source beauty lets you do it in blackletter style. Because nothing says “I read
    the footnotes” like vintage typographic propaganda dressed as objective truth.
